# **Objective**
_This is a fictional project and only for study purposes_

The purpose of this project is to build a simple microservices app to make 2 endpoints communicate to each other.
The first one is an inventory microservice, where products data will be stored, and the other one will provide a platform
to make an order/purchase of a certain product.

# **Tools**

For this project, FastAPI was used to hold the application backend and the framework is made with React.
The data will be stored in a Redis cloud infrastructure with Redis JSON, which is a tool that retrieves
JSON values to a database, and the events will be sent from one microservice to another using Redis Streams. A Redis Stream is 
a data structure that works as an append-only log and is responsible to record and send events in real time.

A Bootstrap template was used. This template can be found at https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/dashboard/
